CARDISTRY

#Cardistry - Card is tree, therefore - cardistry.
An art of shuffling playing cards. Sounds... weird? let me show you the astonishing world of
card shuffling.

## What it is

Cardistry is the performance art of card flourishing. Unlike card magic, cardistry is meant to be visually impressive and appear very hard to execute. The term "cardistry" is a portmanteau of "card" and "artistry". People who engage in cardistry are colloquially known as "cardists".

## Why is it a form of art

Cardistry in its soul is a pure form of expressing creativity. Throughout the years it has developed into its own thing and cardists all around the world have overcome the limitations and boundaries of human vision.
The expression does not stop at coming up with amazing and mind-blowing tricks. The designs of new decks that come out by cardists' initiatives seem to attract more and more attention. They can even be classified as art of their own and here I picked some of the newer and more exciting ones.

## Cardistry-con

Cardistry-Con is an interactive conference centered around the art of cardistry, where cardists from all over the world can gather and explore the limitless expressive potential of an ordinary deck of playing cards.
From 2015, these conferences are being held annually and the number of people interested is growing exponentially. It has to be mentioned that during the pandemic many of the events had to be cancelled, but as the situation is becoming more promising the community is planning to get back on track.
